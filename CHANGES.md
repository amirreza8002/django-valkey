Version 0.3.0
-------------

### New
- official support for cluster servers!!!
- now all operations support omitting exceptions
- `make_key`, `make_pattern`, `encode` and `decode` are now functions, so they can be used outside the backend (e.g: when using the raw client)
- `django_valkey.get_valkey_connection` now works with shard client as well
- replace django's `close_caches` receiver with `close_async_caches` 

### bug fix
- fixed bug of `omit_exception` not handling generator and async generators
- fixed bug of async `get_valkey_connection` checking if the client is async.

### internal change
- `make_key` and `make_pattern` return None if key/pattern is None
- moved all operations from `django_valkey.cache` and `django_valkey.async_cache.cache` to `django_valkey.base`.
- cluster client now uses the same methods as normal client, unless it has to have a specific method.
- prefixing async methods with `a` is done dynamically now; (so no more `aset = set`), it's all handled in `__getattr__`.
- moved async client methods to `django_valkey.base_client.AsyncClientCommands`.
- moved sync client methods to `django_valkey.base_client.ClientCommands`.
- `make_key`, `make_pattern`, `encode`, `decode`, `_decode_iterable_result` are now all sync methods and moved to `django_valkey.base_client.BaseClient`.
- `AsyncHerdClient._pack` and `AsyncHerdClient._unpack` are now sync methods.
- common parts of herd clients now live in `django_valkey.base_client`
- shard client now has `get_client` instead of `get_server`
- all tests now use pytest tools
- use anyio for async tests instead of `pytest-asyncio`
- add editorconfig file
